_This repo was former known as **crunchyroll-go** (which still exists but now contains only the library part) but got split up into two separate repositories to provide more flexibility.
See [#39](https://github.com/crunchy-labs/crunchy-cli/issues/39) for more information._

# üñ•Ô∏è CLI

## ‚ú® Features

- Download single videos and entire series from [crunchyroll](https://www.crunchyroll.com).
- Archive episode or seasons in an `.mkv` file with multiple subtitles and audios and compress them to gzip or zip files.
- Specify a range which episodes to download from an anime.

## üíæ Get the executable

- üì• Download the latest binaries [here](https://github.com/crunchy-labs/crunchy-cli/releases/latest) or get it from below:
  - [Linux (x64)](https://smartrelease.crunchy-labs.org/github/crunchy-labs/crunchy-cli/crunchy-{tag}_linux)
  - [Windows (x64)](https://smartrelease.crunchy-labs.org/github/crunchy-labs/crunchy-cli/crunchy-{tag}_windows.exe)
  - [MacOS (x64)](https://smartrelease.crunchy-labs.org/github/crunchy-labs/crunchy-cli/crunchy-{tag}_darwin)
- If you use Arch btw. or any other Linux distro which is based on Arch Linux, you can download the package via the [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/crunchyroll-go/):
  ```shell
  $ yay -S crunchyroll-go
  ```
- On Windows [scoop](https://scoop.sh/) can be used to install it (added by [@AdmnJ](https://github.com/AdmnJ)):
  ```shell
  $ scoop bucket add extras # <- in case you haven't added the extra repository already
  $ scoop install crunchyroll-go
  ```
  <i>Currently not working because the repo got renamed!</i>
- üõ† Build it yourself. Must be done if your target platform is not covered by the [provided binaries](https://github.com/crunchy-labs/crunchy-cli/releases/latest) (like Raspberry Pi or M1 Mac):
  - use `make` (requires `go` to be installed):
  ```shell
  $ git clone https://github.com/crunchy-labs/crunchy-cli
  $ cd crunchy-cli
  $ make
  $ sudo make install # <- only if you want to install it on your system
  ```
  - use `go`:
  ```shell
  $ git clone https://github.com/crunchy-labs/crunchy-cli
  $ cd crunchy-cli
  $ go build -o crunchy .
  ```

## üìù Examples

_Before reading_: Because of the huge functionality not all cases can be covered in the README. Make sure to check the [wiki](https://github.com/crunchy-labs/crunchy-cli/wiki/Cli), further usages and options are described there.

### Login

Before you can do something, you have to log in first.

This can be performed via crunchyroll account email and password.

```shell
$ crunchy login user@example.com password
```

or via session id

```shell
$ crunchy login --session-id 8e9gs135defhga790dvrf2i0eris8gts
```

### Download

By default, the cli tries to download the episode with your system language as audio. If no streams with your system language are available, the video will be downloaded with japanese audio and hardsubbed subtitles in your system language.
**If your system language is not supported, an error message will be displayed and en-US (american english) will be chosen as language.**

```shell
$ crunchy download https://beta.crunchyroll.com/watch/GRDKJZ81Y/alone-and-lonesome
```

With `-r best` the video(s) will have the best available resolution (mostly 1920x1080 / Full HD).

```shell
$ crunchy download -r best https://beta.crunchyroll.com/watch/GRDKJZ81Y/alone-and-lonesome
```

The file is by default saved as a `.ts` (mpeg transport stream) file.
`.ts` files may can't be played or are looking very weird (it depends on the video player you are using). With the `-o` flag, you can change the name (and file ending) of the output file. So if you want to save it as, for example, `mp4`
file, just name it `whatever.mp4`.
**You need [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org) to store the video in other file formats.**

```shell
$ crunchy download -o "daaaaaaaaaaaaaaaarling.ts" https://beta.crunchyroll.com/watch/GRDKJZ81Y/alone-and-lonesome
```

With the `--audio` flag you can specify which audio the video should have and with `--subtitle` which subtitle it should have. Type `crunchy help download` to see all available locales.

```shell
$ crunchy download --audio ja-JP --subtitle de-DE https://beta.crunchyroll.com/series/GY8VEQ95Y/darling-in-the-franxx
```

##### Flags

The following flags can be (optional) passed to modify the [download](#download) process.

| `-s`  | `--subtitle`   | Forces subtitle of the video(s).                                               |

### Archive

Archive works just like [download](#download). It downloads the given videos as `.mkv` files and stores all (soft) subtitles in it. Default audio locales are japanese and your system language (if available) but you can set more or less with
the `--language` flag.

Archive a file

```shell
$ crunchy archive https://beta.crunchyroll.com/watch/GRDKJZ81Y/alone-and-lonesome
```

Downloads the first two episode of Darling in the FranXX and stores it compressed in a file.

```shell
$ crunchy archive -c "ditf.tar.gz" https://beta.crunchyroll.com/series/GY8VEQ95Y/darling-in-the-franxx
